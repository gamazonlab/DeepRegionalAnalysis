## DeepRegionalAnalysis

Our study fills certain methodological gaps to further our understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of complex traits. First, we provide an approach to obtaining an unbiased estimate of the heritability of gene expression attributable to a local genomic segment, e.g., a regulatory element, a region undergoing selection, or a trait-associated locus. Second, we provide a new Mendelian Randomization approach, with putatively improved power, to infer the causal effect of a modifiable exposure on an outcome, using genetically-determined instruments. For illustration, we apply our methodology to a recently reported GWAS locus associated with COVID-19 severity, specifically, a 50 Kb genomic segment in chromosome 3 that was inherited from Neandertals. We show that heritability estimation of gene expression and causal inference on the effect of an exposure on an outcome can be jointly performed.

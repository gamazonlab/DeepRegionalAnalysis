## DeepRegionalAnalysis

We developed a methodology for a region-level analysis of a complex trait that performs causal inference on an intermediate molecular trait, integrates the evolutionary history of modelled DNA sequences to clarify the trait’s expressivity, and evaluates a region’s broad phenotypic consequences on the human phenome. To illustrate the approach, we applied it to understanding the host genetics of COVID-19 severity. We identified putative causal genes, including SLC6A20 (which functionally interacts with the co-receptor ACE2), CXCR6 (a chemokine receptor), and CCR1 (which may mediate pulmonary fibrosis) in the reproducibly associated locus on 3p21.31, quantifying their effect on mediating expression and on severe COVID-19. We found that individuals who carry an introgressed archaic segment have substantially higher risk of developing the severe disease phenotype, estimating its effect using a novel summary-statistics based approach we developed here and identifying, through large-scale electronic health records, several potential respiratory tract, inflammatory, and immunity related complications. Notably, the inherited segment showed a much higher concentration of expression-mediated causal effect on severity (3.1 - 30.3 times) than the entire locus, explaining, on average, 35.5% of the causal effect. The region-level framework has important implications for the elucidation of molecular mechanisms of disease and the rational design of potentially novel therapeutics.
